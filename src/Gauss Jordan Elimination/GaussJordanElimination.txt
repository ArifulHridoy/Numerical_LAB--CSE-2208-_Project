Gauss-Jordan Elimination Report

What it does :
- Solves linear systems using Gauss-Jordan elimination with partial pivoting.
- Reduces the augmented matrix to Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF).
- Detects three outcomes per test case: Unique Solution, No Solution (inconsistent), Infinite Solutions (dependent).
- Handles multiple test cases in one run, reading from Input.txt and writing to Output.txt while printing to console.

Input format (Input.txt)
- First line: T (number of test cases)
- For each test case:
  - Line: n (number of variables/rows)
  - Next n lines: n+1 numbers per line representing the augmented matrix [A|b]

Algorithm steps
1) Partial pivoting: swap the current row with the row having the largest absolute pivot in the column.
2) Scale the pivot row so the pivot becomes 1.
3) Eliminate the pivot column in all other rows to reach RREF.
4) Check ranks to classify: inconsistent, infinite solutions, or unique solution (read directly from RREF).

Theory (brief)
- Gauss-Jordan applies row operations to convert [A|b] directly to RREF, where each pivot is 1 and the pivot columns have zeros elsewhere.
- Partial pivoting improves numerical stability and avoids dividing by tiny pivots.
- Rank comparison: if rank(A) < rank([A|b]) → inconsistent; if rank(A) < n but rank(A) == rank([A|b]) → infinite solutions; if rank(A) = n → unique solution.

Output format
- For each test case, console and Output.txt show:
  - Header: Test Case k (nxn)
  - Labeled block: Matrix: followed by the augmented matrix values to 3 decimals
  - RREF printed before classification
  - Result line:
	 * Unique Solution
		  x1 = value
		  x2 = value
		  ...
	 * No Solution (Inconsistent)
	 * Infinite Solutions

Sample test cases included
T = 4
1) 3x3 unique solution
	2 1 -1 8
	-3 -1 2 -11
	-2 1 2 -3
2) 2x2 no solution (inconsistent)
	1 2 3
	2 4 5
3) 3x3 infinite solutions (dependent)
	2 4 6 8
	1 2 3 4
	3 6 9 12
4) 2x2 no solution (0 = non-zero)
	1 1 2
	1 1 3

Notes
- Uses tolerance EPS = 1e-10 to treat pivots/coefficients as zero for stability.
