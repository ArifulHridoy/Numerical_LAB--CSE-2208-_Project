LU Decomposition (Doolittle) Report

What it does :
- Solves linear systems by factoring A into L (unit lower) and U (upper) using the Doolittle method.
- Handles multiple test cases, reading from Input.txt, writing to Output.txt, and printing to console.
- Reports L and U matrices; classifies outcomes: unique solution, no solution (inconsistent), or infinitely many solutions (singular but consistent).

Input format (Input.txt)
- First line: T (number of test cases)
- For each test case:
  - Line: n (number of variables/rows)
  - Next n lines: n+1 numbers per line representing augmented matrix [A|b]

Algorithm steps :
1) Doolittle LU factorization without pivoting: U has diagonals from A, L has 1s on the diagonal.
2) Compute y via forward substitution (Ly = b).
3) Detect singularity: if any |U[i][i]| < EPS, flag singular and inspect rows of U with y to classify.
4) If singular and a zero row in U has nonzero y → No solution; if singular and zero row with zero y → Infinite solutions.
5) Only when all pivots are nonzero run back substitution (Ux = y) and print unique solution; always print L and U matrices.

Theory (brief) :
- For nonsingular A with nonzero leading principal minors, A = LU exists with L unit lower-triangular and U upper-triangular (Doolittle sets L diagonals to 1).
- Factorization cost is O(n^3); triangular solves are O(n^2).
- If a pivot is zero, det(A) = 0. This implementation still prints L and U and classifies: inconsistent vs. infinitely many solutions. Partial pivoting (not used here) can often restore a unique solution.

Output format :
- For each test case, console and Output.txt show:
  - Header: Test Case k (nxn)
  - Matrix: the input augmented matrix to 3 decimals
  - L matrix then U matrix (printed always)
  - If all pivots are nonzero: "Unique Solution!" with x1..xn values
  - If any pivot is zero and a zero row matches nonzero y: "Matrix A is singular (det A = 0)" then "=> System has NO solution."
  - If any pivot is zero and zero row matches zero y: "Matrix A is singular (det A = 0)" then "=> System has infinitely many solutions."

Sample test cases included (Input.txt) :
T = 4
1) 3x3 unique solution
	2 1 -1 8
	-3 -1 2 -11
	-2 1 2 -3
2) 2x2 no unique LU (dependent/inconsistent)
	1 2 3
	2 4 5
3) 3x3 infinite solutions (rank-deficient)
	2 4 6 8
	1 2 3 4
	3 6 9 12
4) 2x2 no solution (zero pivot during LU)
	1 1 2
	1 1 3

Notes :
- EPS = 1e-10 is used to detect zero pivots.
- This implementation omits pivoting; matrices requiring pivoting will report failure instead of producing a solution.
