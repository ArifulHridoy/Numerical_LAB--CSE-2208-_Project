POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION - DOCUMENTATION

This program fits a polynomial of chosen degree to given data points using least squares.
Supports multiple test cases in one run.

METHOD:
--------
- Builds normal equations from sums of powers of x and products with y
- Solves the linear system via Gauss-Jordan elimination to obtain coefficients a0..am
- Produces the fitted polynomial in readable form

INPUT FORMAT (Input.txt):
-------------------------
Line 1: Number of test cases (T)

For each test case:
  Line 1: n m            (n data points, polynomial degree m)
  Line 2: n x-values     (space-separated)
  Line 3: n y-values     (space-separated)

EXAMPLE:
--------
Input.txt:
2
5 2
0 1 2 3 4
1 2 1 2 1
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
2 5 10 17 26 37

This represents 2 test cases:
1) 5 points, fit quadratic (degree 2)
2) 6 points, fit cubic (degree 3)

OUTPUT:

For each test case, the program:
1. Shows number of data points and polynomial degree
2. Prints all x and y values
3. Calculates coefficients a0..am
4. Displays the fitted polynomial y = ...
5. Writes the same results to Output.txt

FEATURES:

- Multiple test cases support
- Gauss-Jordan solver for normal equations
- Dynamic precision formatting (6 decimals)
- Console and file output simultaneously
- Compact code with no comments
