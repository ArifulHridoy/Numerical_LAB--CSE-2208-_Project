RUNGE-KUTTA 4TH ORDER METHOD - DOCUMENTATION

This program solves differential equations using the Runge-Kutta 4th Order method.
Supports multiple test cases with different initial conditions.

FUNCTION:
---------
dy/dx = f(x,y) = xy + y

RUNGE-KUTTA 4TH ORDER FORMULA:

y(n+1) = y(n) + (h/6)[k1 + 2k2 + 2k3 + k4]
where:
  k1 = h*f(x(n), y(n))
  k2 = h*f(x(n) + h/2, y(n) + k1/2)
  k3 = h*f(x(n) + h/2, y(n) + k2/2)
  k4 = h*f(x(n) + h, y(n) + k3)

INPUT FORMAT (Input.txt):

Line 1: Number of test cases (T)

For each test case:
  Line 1: Initial x (x0), Initial y (y0), Final x (xn)

EXAMPLE:
--------
Input.txt:
3
0 1 1
0.2 2
1 1 3

This represents 3 test cases:
1. Start at (0, 1), solve to x=1
2. Start at (0.2, 2), solve to x=1
3. Start at (1, 3), solve to x=3

OUTPUT:

The program will:
1. Process all test cases sequentially
2. For each test case:
   - Display initial conditions (x0, y0)
   - Show target x value
   - Display step size and number of iterations
   - Calculate y at xn using Runge-Kutta
   - Write results to Output.txt
3. Clear Output.txt at the start and write all results

FEATURES:

- Multiple test cases support
- Fixed step size: h = 0.0001
- Adaptive iteration count based on x range
- Accurate 4th order method
- Formatted output with precision control
