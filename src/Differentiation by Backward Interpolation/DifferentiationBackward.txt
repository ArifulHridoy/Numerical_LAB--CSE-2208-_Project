DIFFERENTIATION BY BACKWARD INTERPOLATION - DOCUMENTATION

This program computes the derivative of a polynomial at a given point using Newton's Backward
Difference Interpolation formula (5-term approximation). Supports multiple test cases.

NEWTON BACKWARD DIFFERENTIATION (5-TERM):
------------------------------------------
f'(x) ≈ (1/h) * [∇f_n + ((2s+1)/2)∇²f_n + ((3s²+6s+2)/6)∇³f_n 
                 + ((4s³+18s²+22s+6)/24)∇⁴f_n + ((5s⁴+40s³+105s²+100s+24)/120)∇⁵f_n]

where:
  s = (x - x_n) / h
  h = step size
  x_n = last point in the table
  ∇ⁿf_n = nth backward difference at x_n

BACKWARD DIFFERENCE TABLE:
---------------------------
∇f(x_i) = f(x_i) - f(x_{i-1})
∇²f(x_i) = ∇f(x_i) - ∇f(x_{i-1})
∇ⁿf(x_i) = ∇ⁿ⁻¹f(x_i) - ∇ⁿ⁻¹f(x_{i-1})

Best suited for differentiation near the end of the data table.
Requires equally spaced x values.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
- The calculation uses a FIXED 5-TERM formula (up to 5th order backward differences)
- The method is made DYNAMIC only for polynomials of variable degree
- Input polynomial coefficients are c0, c1, c2, ... (constant term first)
- Polynomial format: f(x) = c0 + c1*x + c2*x² + ...

INPUT FORMAT (Input.txt):
-------------------------
Line 1: Number of test cases (T)

For each test case:
  Line 1: Degree of polynomial (d)
  Line 2: Coefficients c0, c1, c2, ... (d+1 values, constant first)
  Line 3: Number of interpolation points (n, at least 6 for 5-term)
  Line 4: x values (n space-separated values, equally spaced)
  Line 5: Point xp where derivative is required

EXAMPLE:

This represents 2 test cases:
1. Polynomial f(x) = 1 + 2x - x² + 0.5x³, 6 points, differentiate at x=4.5
2. Polynomial f(x) = x², 7 points, differentiate at x=2
