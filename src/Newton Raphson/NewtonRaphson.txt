NEWTON-RAPHSON METHOD - DOCUMENTATION

This program finds roots of polynomial functions using the Newton-Raphson iterative method.
Supports multiple test cases with automatic root finding in specified intervals.

NEWTON-RAPHSON FORMULA:
-----------------------
x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)

Starting from an initial guess x₀, the method iteratively improves the approximation
until convergence. Requires the function to be differentiable.

CONVERGENCE CRITERIA:
--------------------
The iteration stops when:
  |x_{n+1} - x_n| < E  (successive approximations are close)
  OR
  |f(x_n)| < E  (function value is near zero)

The method has quadratic convergence near simple roots, making it very efficient.

INPUT FORMAT (Input.txt):
-------------------------
Line 1: Number of test cases (T)

For each test case:
  Line 1: Degree of polynomial (n)
  Line 2: Coefficients (n+1 values) from highest degree to constant term
  Line 3: Search interval [a, b], Tolerance (E)
  Line 4: Maximum iterations allowed

EXAMPLE:
--------
Input.txt:
2
3
1 -6 11 -6
0 5 0.0001
50
4
1 0 -5 0 4
-3 5 0.0001
100

This represents 2 test cases:
1. f(x) = x³ - 6x² + 11x - 6, search in [0,5], tolerance 0.0001, max 50 iterations
2. f(x) = x⁴ - 5x² + 4, search in [-3,5], tolerance 0.0001, max 100 iterations

OUTPUT:

The program will:
1. Process all test cases sequentially
2. For each test case:
   - Display the polynomial equation in readable format
   - Show search interval, tolerance, and max iterations
   - Test multiple starting points across the interval (step 0.5)
   - Apply Newton-Raphson from each starting point
   - Collect unique roots (rounded to 3 decimal places)
   - Display each root with iteration count required
   - Write all results to Output.txt
3. Output both to console and file simultaneously

FEATURES:

- Multiple test cases support
- Automatic polynomial evaluation
- Derivative calculation (analytical)
- Multiple starting points for comprehensive root finding
- Duplicate root filtering
- Iteration count tracking for each root
- Division by zero protection (checks if f'(x) ≈ 0)
- Invalid result filtering (checks for NaN/Inf)
- High precision output (6 decimal places)
- Console and file output simultaneously
- Input validation and error handling
- Compact code with no comments

ADVANTAGES:
- Fast quadratic convergence
- Requires fewer iterations than bisection/false position
- Works well for simple roots

LIMITATIONS:
- Requires derivative calculation
- May fail if f'(x) = 0 at iteration point
- May not converge for bad initial guesses
- May miss some roots if starting points are poorly chosen
