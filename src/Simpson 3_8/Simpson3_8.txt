SIMPSON'S 3/8 RULE - DOCUMENTATION

This program calculates the definite integral of polynomial functions using Simpson's 3/8 Rule.
Supports multiple test cases in a single run.

SIMPSON'S 3/8 RULE FORMULA:
---------------------------
∫[a,b] f(x)dx ≈ (3h/8)[f(a) + 3Σf(i≠multiple of 3) + 2Σf(i=multiple of 3) + f(b)]
where h = (b-a)/n and n must be a MULTIPLE OF 3

INPUT FORMAT (Input.txt):
-------------------------
Line 1: Number of test cases (T)

For each test case:
  Line 1: Degree of polynomial (n)
  Line 2: Coefficients (n+1 values) from highest degree to constant term
  Line 3: Lower limit (a), Upper limit (b), Number of intervals (n - must be MULTIPLE OF 3)

EXAMPLE:
--------
Input.txt:
3
2
1 0 0
0 2 6
3
1 -3 2 0
1 4 9
4
1 0 0 0 -1
0 1 12

This represents 3 test cases:
1. f(x) = x^2, integrate from 0 to 2 with 6 intervals
2. f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x, integrate from 1 to 4 with 9 intervals
3. f(x) = x^4 - 1, integrate from 0 to 1 with 12 intervals

OUTPUT:

The program will:
1. Process all test cases sequentially
2. For each test case:
   - Display the function equation in readable format
   - Show integration parameters (limits, intervals, step size)
   - Calculate the integral using Simpson's 3/8 rule
   - Display results in console
   - Write results to Output.txt
3. Clear Output.txt at the start and write all results

FEATURES:

- Multiple test cases support
- Dynamic polynomial evaluation
- Automatic function string generation
- Input validation (checks if n is multiple of 3)
- Formatted output with precision control
- Shows step size (h) calculation
