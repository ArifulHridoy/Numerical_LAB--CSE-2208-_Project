Gaussian Elimination Report

What it does
- Solves linear systems using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting.
- Detects three outcomes per test case: Unique Solution, No Solution (inconsistent), Infinite Solutions (dependent).
- Handles multiple test cases in a single run, reading from Input.txt and writing to Output.txt while printing to console.

Input format (Input.txt)
- First line: T (number of test cases)
- For each test case:
  - Line: n (number of variables/rows)
  - Next n lines: n+1 numbers per line representing the augmented matrix [A|b]

Algorithm steps
1) Partial pivoting each column to select the largest pivot.
2) Forward elimination to upper-triangular form.
3) Consistency checks for zero/near-zero pivots and zero rows.
4) Back substitution when a unique solution exists.

Theory (brief)
- Gaussian elimination transforms the augmented matrix [A|b] into an upper-triangular form U via elementary row operations.
- Partial pivoting swaps rows to place the largest available pivot on the diagonal, reducing numerical error and avoiding division by tiny pivots.
- If a pivot column becomes all zeros but the augmented part is non-zero, the system is inconsistent (no solution). If both are zero, the system may have infinitely many solutions.
- Once U is obtained with non-zero diagonal entries, back substitution solves Ux = c efficiently from bottom to top.

Output format
- For each test case, console and Output.txt show:
  - Header: Test Case k (nxn)
  - Labeled block: Matrix: followed by the augmented matrix values to 3 decimals
  - Result line:
	  * Unique Solution
		  x1 = value
		  x2 = value
		  ...
	  * No Solution
	  * Infinite Solutions

Outputs
- Console and Output.txt show, per test case:
  - The augmented matrix (formatted to 3 decimals)
  - One of: Unique Solution with variable values; No Solution; Infinite Solutions

Sample test cases included
T = 4
1) 3x3 unique solution
	2 1 -1 8
	-3 -1 2 -11
	-2 1 2 -3
2) 2x2 no solution (inconsistent)
	1 2 3
	2 4 5
3) 3x3 infinite solutions (dependent)
	2 4 6 8
	1 2 3 4
	3 6 9 12
4) 2x2 no solution (0 = non-zero)
	1 1 2
	1 1 3


Notes
- Uses a tolerance of 1e-10 to treat pivots or coefficients as zero for stability.
